# :guitar: Fan Finder

## Welcome to Fan Finder!

Fan Finder is a location-based social networking app based on live music gigs, allowing users to find gigs in their area and interact with other music fans.

This project was initially built as part of a team of 4 (big shout out to Team Express!) during the amazing [Northcoders Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/) with the aim of demonstrating & developing the following skills:

* Spiking our own choice of new technologies
* Building a React Native mobile app
* Building a RESTful Web API
* Interacting with Mongo databases
* Developing using TDD, pair programming and remote working as part of a small team
* Use of Agile methodologies, inc. Kanban boards and daily Stand Ups
* Implementing the Software Development Lifecycle framework

## Features

* View all upcoming gigs within a 30 mile radius of the users current location
* View details of a a specific gig, with a direct link to buy tickets
* Access a forum for each gig to view/add comments for all users to see
* Chat directly with other users of the app
* View users profile, including upcoming gigs & forum rank

## Using Fan Finder

The app has not been published to the Apple / Google Play store, however there are two options to see the app in action:

### Option One - Android users only!

Due to a change in Apple policy this option is now only available to Android smart phone users.

Simply [download the Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/expo-go) and scan the QR code below. The app will then build to your device within 20 seconds or so, but please bear in mind the backend is hosted on the free tier of Render so you may have to be patient with the forum/chat features until the server wakes up!
