# :guitar: Fan Finder

## Welcome to Fan Finder!

Fan Finder is a location-based social networking app based on live music gigs, allowing users to find gigs in their area and interact with other music fans.

This project was initially built as part of a team of 4 (big shout out to Team Express!) during the amazing [Northcoders Full-Stack Software Developer Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/) with the aim of demonstrating & developing the following skills:

* Spiking our own choice of new technologies
* Building a React Native mobile app
* Building a RESTful Web API
* Interacting with Mongo databases
* Developing using TDD, pair programming and remote working as part of a small team
* Use of Agile methodologies, inc. Kanban boards and daily Stand Ups
* Implementing the Software Development Lifecycle framework

## Features

* View all upcoming gigs within a 30 mile radius of the users current location
* View a specific gig's details inc. a direct link to buy tickets
* Comment on a specific gig for other users to see
* Chat with other users of the app
* View user profile inc. upcoming gigs & forum rank

A live version of this API can be found here:

https://backend-project-nc-news-49l4.onrender.com/

Please bear in mind this is hosted on a free tier of Render so may take a few seconds to start.

Alternatively, to run a local copy please ensure you are running node (minimum version 19.5.0) and postgreSQL (minimum version 14.6), then follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jbhall4291/backend-nc-news
   ```

2. Change into this repos directory:
   ```
   cd backend-nc-news
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Use the provided scripts to set up and seed the dev and test databases.
   ```
   npm run setup-dbs && npm run seed
   ```

5. Create the following two .env files in the main project folder:
   ```
   .env.test
   .env.development
   ```

   Into each of these files, add the single line *PGDATABASE=<database_name_placeholder>*, replacing the placeholder text with the corresponding database name for each environment. Please see `/db/setup.sql` for what each database should be. Double check that these .env files are in `.gitignored`!

6. Start the express server and the app will start listening on 
port 9090 of your localhost
   ```
   npm start
   ```
7. Point your browser at `localhost:9090/api` to see a list of all the endpoints, how to interact with them, and example responses.

8. This app has been fully tested with the use of Jest and the Supertest library. To install the necessary dependencies and run the test suite use:
   ```
   npm install -D jest jest-sorted supertest
   npm test
   ```
